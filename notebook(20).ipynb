    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project was to analyze a telecom company’s customer data to understand factors contributing to customer churn and build an analytical foundation for predictive modeling. The task required merging multiple customer datasets, identifying inconsistencies and data quality issues, exploring customer behavior patterns, and preparing a clean dataset suitable for downstream machine-learning models. Ultimately, the goal was to identify key business insights that inform customer retention strategies.\n"

We want to identify patterns,behaviors,mannerisms associated with all the services provided by telecom. Behaviors associated with contract types,payment type,service bundle and of course price.

    "Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Telecom churn analysis focuses on understanding why customers discontinue their services. This project involved integrating several datasets containing contract information, personal demographic attributes, internet service usage, and phone service records. The analysis required conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), validating data consistency, handling data anomalies, and documenting insights related to pricing, payment methods, service adoption, and revenue trends. The project concludes by preparing the foundation for applying predictive models such as logistic regression and boosting algorithms.\n",

    "2. Solution and Implementation\n",
    "Solution Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution followed a structured data analysis workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading – Imported contract, personal, internet, and phone service datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Validation – Compared unique customer IDs across datasets to detect irregularities such as mismatched record counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning – Identified empty strings in numerical fields (e.g., \"TotalCharges\"), converted types, handled missing values, and documented dropped records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Analysis – Conducted customer revenue analysis, payment method comparisons, and service adoption patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn Target Preparation – Converted EndDate into a churn indicator for future modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Foundation – Established logistic regression as the baseline model and prepared merged datasets for machine-learning pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach used iterative refinement: investigating anomalies, correcting them, and evaluating the impact on data fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system architecture consisted of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Layer: Four raw CSV datasets (contract.csv, personal.csv, internet.csv, phone.csv).\n",

    "\n",
    "Summary insights for predictive modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Left-join merging was selected to prevent losing contract records, which are the core of churn analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping 11 records with invalid TotalCharges was chosen because the group was too small to justify imputation and likely represented new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric conversion over string-preservation prevented downstream modeling issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified splitting (planned) for modeling ensures proper class balance for churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Details\n",
    "Key Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas DataFrames: primary structure for tabular data.\n",

    "Naming Conventions\n",

    "This project successfully brought together multiple telecom customer datasets to uncover the key drivers of churn through systematic cleaning, merging, exploratory analysis, and model development. By validating data quality issues—such as discrepancies in unique customer counts—and analyzing customer cohorts, pricing behavior, and service usage patterns, the project built a clear understanding of how monthly charges, contract type, tenure, and service combinations contribute to customer attrition. The evaluation of baseline models such as logistic regression helped establish foundational predictive performance, while insights from the exploratory analysis provided actionable business guidance for targeted retention efforts. Overall, this work provides a strong analytical framework for both predicting churn and informing strategic initiatives to improve customer retention and revenue stability"
